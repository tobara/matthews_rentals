From landscaping to construction, experience maximum versatility in Kubota's B26TLB utility tractor.
 Loaded with a 26 HP Kubota diesel engine, standard 4-Wheel Drive and sloped loader arms and hood designed 
for improved visibility on the work site, the B26 takes productivity to the next level.




Added horsepower; loader-lifting capacity; backhoe digging power and depth make the B26 a star workhorse for light construction,
 agricultural work or around the home. The versatility of this highly maneuverable, combination TLB makes the Kubota B26 TLB 
three machines in one. Whether the job calls for a tractor with 3-point implements, backhoe, or loader applications, the B26 
can take on all three applications. The B26 TLB also has a sleek, modern design that improves operator visibility. It also offers 
a skid-steer-type quick coupler for convenient attachment of a variety of implements.
