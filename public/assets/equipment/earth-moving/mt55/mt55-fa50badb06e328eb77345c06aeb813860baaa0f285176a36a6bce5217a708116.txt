Bobcat MT55 Mini Track Loader

The Bobcat® MT55 mini track loader tackles big jobs in close quarters with impressive traction and lifting abilities. It turns quickly in its tracks, 
treads lightly over soft ground and provides endless work-saving opportunities.  The MT55 can complete a long list of jobs. Use it for trenching, digging,
carrying materials, demolition, site preparation, snow removal, utility installation, sweeping, stump grinding and more.

Walk behind the MT55 or choose the ride-on platform that attaches quickly and easily. Used by itself or as a complement to bigger loaders, the MT55 excels as a work-saver.
